# Lists of input images. Can either be an explicit list ([image1, image2, ...])
# or a globbed file path (/path/to/images/*.jpg) or a path to a text file.
# (The text file should contain a list of paths to images, one path per line)
inputs:
    artificial0: '{harness_dir}/../../data/images/artificial0/*.png'
    kondo1_bf:   '{harness_dir}/../../data/images/kondo1_bifilter/*.png'
    pioneer2:    '{harness_dir}/../../data/images/pioneer2/*filtered.jpg'
    test:        '{harness_dir}/../../data/images/artificial0/0099.png'

# Same rules as above, but with the ground truth images this time.
# Ground truth images must have the same 'base' filenames as your input files,
# but anything past the first underscore '_' is ignored.
# Must be defined in the same order as your image sets above.
ground_truths:
    artificial0: '{harness_dir}/../../data/ground_truth/artificial0/*.png'
    kondo1_bf:   '{harness_dir}/../../data/ground_truth/kondo1/*.png'
    pioneer2:    '{harness_dir}/../../data/ground_truth/pioneer2/*gt.png'
